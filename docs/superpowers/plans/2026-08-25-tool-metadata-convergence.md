# Tool Metadata Convergence Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task.

**Goal:** Replace every duplicated Python runtime classification of the 25 Typed tools with one immutable, validated `ToolMetadataBundleV1`, while preserving the exact 25/3/4 Typed/Legacy/Compensation boundary and all Provider, HITL, Ledger, HTTP/SSE, Journal, database, and business-side-effect contracts.

**Architecture:** The six domain modules declare complete `ToolSpec` values. A generic compiler validates and freezes those 25 specs together with discovery policy, three static Legacy adapters, and four Compensation handlers into one application-scoped Bundle. Narrow Provider, Discovery, Authority, Operation, Legacy, and Compensation views are injected from the same Bundle. Per-Segment leases and opaque route/proof handles preserve provenance without recompiling metadata or persisting runtime objects.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.10+, pytest 8, SQLAlchemy 2, SQLite, FastAPI, jsonschema 4.26.0, the existing Agent Loop/Pilot Runtime/Context Projector/Tool Pipeline/Tool Authority/Write Operation Ledger/Journal, uv, Ruff, Mypy, Vitest, Vite, local verification, controlled real-AI verification, and the in-app browser.

**Scope revisions:** Task 4 was first formally stopped before product edits after the original baseline-only `ToolSpec(` scan missed `dataclasses.replace()` consumers, attribute readers, and the Task 3 synthetic factory. During the reviewed Task 4 full GREEN matrix it was stopped again when two pre-existing Authority tests proved to construct a production Spec as a non-closed one-tool Catalog, and the production Authority capability validator began tripping the existing no-automatic-grant AST gate after `ToolCapability` became the closed enum. Its independent implementation review then found that the temporary compatibility mapping returned mutable nested Provider JSON and left `dict(contract.payload)` materializers in the AI client and Context Projector. Task 4 was stopped a third time before touching those out-of-gate consumers. The reviewed Task 4 scope below explicitly includes all seventeen supplemental consumers, migrates the two test Catalogs to explicit closed test metadata, validates capability values directly without materializing the whole enum, and atomically moves every Provider JSON consumer to one recursively immutable query surface plus one detached materializer. A later independent Task 4 review also found that the baseline-derived Task 12 classification scan could not discover the now-dead `BindingResolverSpec`/`aggregate_binding` compatibility surface or the test-fixture `BindingTarget` fallback in `tool_specs/common.py`. Product work stopped before touching that out-of-allowlist file; the reviewed Task 12 scope now explicitly includes the three defining/export modules and `tool_specs/common.py`, and its deletion gate closes those final compatibility paths after the Authority/Pipeline handle cutover. Task 9 was formally stopped when independent review proved three frozen-scope gaps: the production Journal surface writer could not receive the required same-Bundle Provider view through its `RunRecorder` contract, a second exact Typed Catalog could bypass Bundle provenance, and the complete Operation Port accepted only initial Legacy route handles rather than proof-derived confirmation handles. The reviewed Task 9 scope now includes the exact Journal module and its two direct compatibility/gate suites plus the Legacy proof consumer and sealed composite route Port needed to validate both route origins without widening the generic Operation Port. The same review found six direct test consumers of the removed Selector/Authority dependency-policy parameter that the Task 9 file list and matrix had missed; those exact tests are now migrated and gated in Task 9 rather than deferred to an impossible Task 11 cleanup. Task 9 was stopped once more when its directory-wide Ruff formatting command selected two baseline Agent Loop tests outside the frozen Task 9 allowlist; the reviewed command below keeps the full Agent Loop pytest compatibility matrix while restricting Ruff mutation checks to the two exact Agent Loop files owned by Task 9. Task 10 was formally stopped before product edits after RED tests proved the frozen scope could not obtain a Bundle-owned lease: `ToolMetadataBundleV1.open_segment_lease()` is the only approved issuer, while the scoped Segment surface builder and Approval invocation received only a raw Catalog and the two production injection points in Pilot Runtime Composition/Service were absent. A complete AST review also found the original Task 10 list omitted direct `prepare_call()`/`execute_prepared()`, Authority raw-Spec registration, Segment-surface, Agent Loop invocation, and claimed-write consumers. The reviewed Task 10 scope below includes both production injection points, the typed Prepared contract, the generic lease issuer/registry primitives, the claimed-write caller, and every direct test consumer; it issues one exact lease for NewTurn, Approval, and continuation Segments from the same Bundle, closes them on every exit, and forbids a private issuer, raw-Catalog overload, or test-only compatibility branch. Task 10 was formally stopped again during independent implementation review when it found that the execution revalidation fast path did not revalidate the owning Catalog topology, two AST ownership gates could be bypassed through method aliases or renamed receivers, the `PreparedToolCall.spec_handle` field still retained an optional default, and the active proposal Journal still classified operation/confirmation from raw Spec metadata. Making the handle exact and required affects four direct constructor tests outside the then-frozen Task 10 file list, while the Journal cutover affects one additional production module. The reviewed Task 10 scope now includes all five consumers, requires Catalog-topology fail-closed revalidation before execution, and makes the source gates alias/dataflow robust. These scope-only revisions do not change the approved design, fixed identities, 25/3/4 boundary, protocol seals, or Golden assets.

**Task 9 final scope stop:** The Pilot confirmation policy-resolver compatibility test still required a second exact Segment Catalog. Task 9 now owns that one Catalog-identity migration, while Task 11 retains the same file for the separate Legacy proof/replay cutover. This does not change the approved design, fixed identities, 25/3/4 boundary, protocol seals, or Golden assets.

**Task 11 scope stop:** Product work stopped after the RED suites exposed omissions in the frozen Task 11 scope. The proof-only final `LegacyDeterministicCatalog` is constructed and annotated by `pilot_runtime/legacy_route.py`, while `pilot_runtime/composition.py` still injects the raw Catalog factory and `tool_specs/legacy.py` still defines it; none of these direct production consumers was listed. Deleting the raw-Pending Catalog without migrating all three would require a forbidden forwarding alias or dead dependency façade. The Task 11 GREEN command also runs all of `tests/pilot_runtime`, both Write Operation suites, and the Task 7-8 Legacy metadata suites. `test_deterministic.py`, `test_legacy_initial_route.py`, and `test_legacy_registry_composition.py` still assert the deliberately unpublished raw-Pending Catalog contract; `test_write_operations.py` and `test_write_operation_acceptance_matrix.py` were frozen for Task 12, while the omitted baseline direct consumer `test_persistence.py` was not present in the previous global allowlist. All three directly call the Pending repository methods whose raw claim overload is removed in this Task, so a required exact route-handle signature would make GREEN impossible without an optional compatibility path. Task 11 now owns these nine exact migrations so the proof-only and Pending persistence cutovers can be atomic and compatibility-free. Task 12 may still revisit repeated files for its separate mechanical deletion gates. This scope-only revision does not change the approved design, fixed identities, 25/3/4 boundary, protocol seals, or Golden assets.

**Task 11 second scope stop:** Product work stopped again before retaining any production edit when the proof-only cutover removed the old `build_static_legacy_adapter_catalog` name. `test_legacy_confirmation_proof.py` and `test_production_bundle.py` are both in the required Task 11 GREEN matrix and directly call or monkeypatch that old builder, but neither test was in the frozen Task 11 file list. Leaving the old name reachable would be the compatibility facade expressly forbidden by this Task, while renaming it without migrating both direct consumers makes GREEN impossible. Independent scope review then found two Pilot Runtime persistence fakes selected by GREEN but absent from the Task file list, one Agent Loop confirmation test that directly passes the removed raw Catalog to `prepare_pending_action()`, and six Authority/extraction suites that directly create primary Ledger rows without the exact sealed route required by this Task. Task 11 now owns these eleven exact test migrations and runs each in RED and GREEN. No production path, public contract, fixed identity, 25/3/4 boundary, protocol seal, or Golden asset changes as a result of this scope-only correction.

**Task 11 third scope stop:** Independent implementation review found that `pilot_runtime/service.py` still owned the baseline special success summaries for `create_application`, `add_note`, and `create_application_event`. Deleting that name switch while preserving the HTTP/SSE text contract requires those three already-compiled exact presentation bindings to own the corresponding projector behavior; the defining domain Spec modules were frozen in Task 4 but omitted from Task 11. Task 11 now revisits exactly `tool_specs/applications.py`, `tool_specs/notes.py`, and `tool_specs/application_events.py` for this presentation-only cutover. This is not a new classification, Provider, schema, business, seal, or Golden change: the exact typed result remains the sole projector input and the service consumes only the sealed binding projection.

**Task 11 fourth scope stop:** The integrated Legacy approval RED tests proved that the Ledger fingerprint and executor must consume the same exact proof-prepared effective arguments, while the caller may no longer supply `input_fingerprint`. The sealed `PreparedLegacyCall` lifecycle and its owning `LegacyPreparationRegistry` are defined in `ai/tool_runtime/legacy_proof.py`; implementing a read-only `LegacyPreparedInputPort` anywhere else would require exporting registry internals, retaining a caller-computed fingerprint, or adding a forwarding compatibility façade. That direct production owner was omitted from the frozen Task 11 list even though `test_legacy_confirmation_proof.py` and `test_approval_transaction.py` already exercise the required identity/revocation behavior. Task 11 now revisits exactly `src/offerpilot/ai/tool_runtime/legacy_proof.py`, includes it in Ruff/Mypy verification, and keeps the prepared Port unpublished outside the exact production confirmation-route components. This is a scope-only correction: it does not change the approved design, fixed identities, 25/3/4 boundary, Provider/Legacy seals, Golden assets, public API, schema, migration, or business behavior.

**Task 11 fifth scope stop:** The required directory-wide Agent Loop GREEN matrix exposed six direct `AgentLoopRunner` Typed-Pending tests in `tests/agent_loop/test_runner.py` that still constructed a Segment invocation without binding the exact Operation/Pending persistence Ports. Production now correctly fails closed before releasing such an unbound Pending, so retaining those fixtures would make the required GREEN command impossible unless product code restored a forbidden raw-Pending fallback. Product work stopped without weakening that boundary. Task 11 now revisits exactly this existing Task 4 test consumer and migrates its shared invocation fixture to a test-owned exact Operation/Pending Port graph and persistence consumer. No production optional branch, fallback, public contract, fixed identity, 25/3/4 boundary, Provider/Legacy seal, Golden asset, schema, migration, or business behavior changes as a result of this scope-only correction.

**Task 12 scope stop:** Product work stopped before any Task 12 production edit when independent scope review proved that the baseline-only classification scan did not include `LEGACY_DETERMINISTIC_NAMES`, so it omitted both the defining `ai/tool_runtime/legacy.py` module and the public `pilot_runtime/__init__.py` re-export. The same baseline-only scan necessarily could not discover twelve Task 4-11 tests introduced after the fixed baseline that still consume the global Typed Catalog; two of them are selected directly by the required Task 12 GREEN command, while the remainder are selected by Task 13's full metadata matrix. Removing the global Catalog without migrating these exact consumers would require a forbidden test-only production façade or leave collection failures. The reviewed Task 12 scope now includes those fourteen exact production/test paths, supplements the immutable baseline scan explicitly, and runs every frozen Task 12 test consumer before the deletion commit. This scope-only correction does not change the approved design, fixed identities, 25/3/4 boundary, protocol seals, Golden assets, public API, schema, migration, or business behavior.

**Task 12 second scope stop:** Product work stopped again before editing an out-of-gate production file when independent implementation review strengthened the required reflective-classification AST gate and exposed four surviving `_attribute(..., "operation"|"adapter_kind")` decisions in `pilot_runtime/continuation.py`. The fixed-baseline name scan cannot discover helper-mediated reflection, and this already-reviewed Task 11 owner was therefore absent from the frozen Task 12 list even though the Task 12 gate scans the complete production tree. Weakening the gate or retaining those decisions would violate the mechanical-deletion requirement; changing the file without a reviewed gate would violate the immutable scope. Task 12 now revisits exactly `src/offerpilot/pilot_runtime/continuation.py` to replace those four reflective classifications with exact bounded Ledger/route fields and remove the remaining preheader compatibility shape. The strengthened gate also adds explicit negative probes for helper-mediated reflection, generic Provider dict registries, Legacy proof Repository capture/query, generic initial-route receivers, aliased Golden writers, and name switches inside `tool_specs`. This scope-only correction does not change the approved design, fixed identities, 25/3/4 boundary, Provider/Legacy seals, Golden assets, public API, schema, migration, or business behavior.

Do not modify the root workspace, push, merge, rebase, or create another implementation branch. Preserve unrelated user changes. Use `apply_patch` for source edits. Run `git add` and `git commit` as separate commands. Commit messages must use `<type>: AI <中文主题>`.

Before product edits, create these immutable gate files:

```text
%TEMP%\offerpilot-tool-metadata-convergence-gate\baseline.txt
%TEMP%\offerpilot-tool-metadata-convergence-gate\implementation-start.txt
%TEMP%\offerpilot-tool-metadata-convergence-gate\allowlist.txt
%TEMP%\offerpilot-tool-metadata-convergence-gate\task-01.txt ... task-13.txt
%TEMP%\offerpilot-tool-metadata-convergence-gate.locator.json
```

Rules:

- `baseline.txt` contains only the full fixed production baseline above.
- `implementation-start.txt` contains only the full fixed implementation-start identity above. Gate regeneration after a reviewed scope stop must preserve it and must not substitute the then-current `HEAD`.
- `allowlist.txt` contains exactly the union of all per-Task paths. Task 13 explicitly contains the already reviewed design, this implementation plan, the final verification report, and the inherited Tasks 1-12 path union, so the global equality is mechanical rather than exceptional.
- each `task-NN.txt` contains the exact repository-relative file paths allowed for that Task; no directory, glob, or prefix entry is valid.
- locator JSON records absolute worktree, branch, the three core file paths, and the per-Task gate directory.
- tests and implementation scripts may read these files but may never rewrite, accept, or regenerate them.
- every final scope comparison uses the fixed baseline, never the implementation-start commit.

Before writing product files, materialize every per-Task path list and its union. Literal `Files` entries are copied exactly. The computed entries are the three baseline-only scan sets named in Tasks 2, 4, and 12 plus Task 13's exact inherited union of Tasks 1-12; resolve the three scan sets from the fixed commit before any source edit:

```powershell
$fixed = '0c10e05e256eb757d5f89a8b009dcea193f2fc78'
$capabilityImportSet = git grep -l 'ToolCapability' $fixed -- src tests | ForEach-Object { $_ -replace '^[^:]+:', '' }
$toolSpecConstructorSet = git grep -l 'ToolSpec(' $fixed -- src tests | ForEach-Object { $_ -replace '^[^:]+:', '' }
$classificationConsumerSet = git grep -l -E 'MODEL_TOOL_NAMES|MODEL_TOOL_CATALOG|LEGACY_DETERMINISTIC_NAMES|DEPENDENCY_POLICY_V1|TRANSACTIONAL_TYPED_WRITE_NAMES|REQUIRED_UNDO_TOOL_NAMES|TYPED_WRITE_OPERATION_NAMES|LEGACY_WRITE_OPERATION_NAMES|COMPENSATION_OPERATION_NAMES|REQUIRED_UNDO_OPERATION_NAMES|WRITE_OPERATION_NAMES|_pending_adapter_kind|_chained_adapter_kind|_with_write_contract|_with_runtime_metadata|editable_fields_for_tool|_undo_seed_for_pending|_build_write_undo|_CREATED_RECORD_FINGERPRINT_FIELDS|legacy_catalog_factory|_legacy_catalog|_legacy_adapter' $fixed -- src tests | ForEach-Object { $_ -replace '^[^:]+:', '' }
```

The baseline-only `$toolSpecConstructorSet` is intentionally supplemented in Task 4 by these seventeen explicitly reviewed paths, because a `ToolSpec(` text scan cannot discover `dataclasses.replace()`, attribute reads, source-gate fallout from the closed enum cutover, Provider JSON materializers, or files introduced after the fixed baseline:

```text
tests/agent_loop/helpers.py
tests/agent_loop/test_runner.py
src/offerpilot/ai/tool_authority/contracts.py
tests/tool_authority/test_approval_transaction.py
tests/tool_authority/test_read_uow.py
tests/tool_authority/test_replay_topology.py
tests/tool_metadata/factories.py

tests/tool_pipeline/test_jd_analyses.py
tests/tool_pipeline/test_notes.py
tests/tool_pipeline/test_offers.py
tests/tool_pipeline/test_resumes.py
```

Task 12 uses this explicitly reviewed fifteen-path closure: the revised baseline scan captures the two production Legacy definition/re-export paths, the helper-mediated reflective decisions require the explicit Continuation owner, and the remaining twelve test supplements cannot be discovered from the fixed commit because Tasks 4-11 introduced them later. Sorting and de-duplication make the closure mechanical when the scan and supplements overlap:

```text
src/offerpilot/ai/tool_runtime/legacy.py
src/offerpilot/pilot_runtime/__init__.py
src/offerpilot/pilot_runtime/continuation.py
tests/test_agent_run_journal.py
tests/tool_metadata/test_compensation_registry.py
tests/tool_metadata/test_compiler.py
tests/tool_metadata/test_legacy_confirmation_proof.py
tests/tool_metadata/test_legacy_initial_route.py
tests/tool_metadata/test_legacy_registry_composition.py
tests/tool_metadata/test_manifest.py
tests/tool_metadata/test_operation_port.py
tests/tool_metadata/test_presentation_bindings.py
tests/tool_metadata/test_production_bundle.py
tests/tool_metadata/test_published_operation_checks.py
tests/tool_metadata/test_selector_views.py
```

Do not replace this explicit supplement with a broader runtime grep or dynamically append scan results to a gate. Future scope discoveries still require the stop/revise/re-review/regenerate procedure below.

Normalize separators to `/`, sort ordinally, remove duplicates, review the explicit results, then write immutable `task-NN.txt` files and their union. No task may append a path later. If implementation discovers a required path outside the frozen union, stop, document the reason, revise/re-review the plan, and regenerate all gate files before resuming; never silently widen the allowlist.

After such a reviewed scope stop, the regenerated `task-13.txt` already owns this implementation plan as a scope anchor. Before resuming the interrupted product Task, create one administrative scope-revision commit that stages only `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-25-tool-metadata-convergence.md`, verifies that exact staged path against `task-13.txt`, and uses a `docs: AI ...` message. This checkpoint does not complete Task 13 or stage its report/design anchor; it ensures the final Task 13 pre-report dirty gate does not inherit an uncommitted plan revision.

Every commit uses its task file, never a directory-level `git add`:

```powershell
$taskPaths = @(Get-Content -LiteralPath "$env:TEMP\offerpilot-tool-metadata-convergence-gate\task-NN.txt" | Where-Object { $_ })
git add -- $taskPaths
$staged = @(git diff --cached --name-only)
$outsideTask = @($staged | Where-Object { $taskPaths -notcontains $_ })
if ($outsideTask.Count -ne 0) { throw "staged path outside task allowlist: $($outsideTask -join ', ')" }
```

For the ignored final report only, replace `git add --` with `git add -f --`. The task file must already contain the report path.

### External contracts that must remain unchanged

```text
Provider surface: exact 25 complete envelopes, same order/name/description/schema.
Legacy boundary: exact 3 deterministic tools, never model-visible.
Compensation boundary: exact 4 operation kinds, never model-visible.
HTTP/SSE: no removed, renamed, reordered, or newly required fields/events.
HITL: approve/modify/reject, Pending identity, claim/CAS, chained Pending unchanged.
Ledger: operation-scoped terminal at-most-once, replay, delivery fencing, commit-unknown unchanged.
Journal: existing event types, schemas, result_contract, and 25+3 tool whitelist unchanged.
Database: no model, table, column, index, CHECK, trigger, or migration changes.
Provider/tool calls: no hidden retry, fallback, double execution, or shadow path.
```

The implementation is internally destructive. The final branch must contain no feature flag, dual registry, compatibility forwarding property, shadow execution, automatic Golden updater, Typed-to-Legacy fallback, runtime rollback switch, or name-based runtime classification outside the exact historical compatibility allowlist.

### Fixed 25/3/4 truth

Typed order:

```text
list_applications
get_application
create_application
update_application_status
list_application_events
get_application_event
create_application_event

update_offer
save_offer_assessment
list_resumes

resume_rewrite_highlight
list_resume_matches
list_jd_analyses
get_jd_analysis
```

Required Undo bindings:

```text
create_application        -> delete_application        -> undo:create_application
update_application_status -> update_application_status -> undo:update_application_status
create_application_event  -> delete_application_event  -> undo:create_application_event
add_note                  -> delete_note               -> undo:add_note
```

Legacy initial-route bindings:

```text
jd_clarification           -> save_application_jd_version
jd_deterministic_action    -> save_application_jd_version
submission_snapshot_action -> create_application_submission_snapshot
outcome_recording_action   -> record_application_outcome
confirmation_resume        -> proof-only; never an initial issuer
```

Approved whole-boundary seals:

```text
Provider: sha256:db60a499a2c76fa46e769214cbdce1488bb86b2f67941d6ae961f25ed997e98b
Legacy:   sha256:7d1d6b7e6cf3953b1a17e7a81c9d5655b5366de25b263ea6bd89a646c2f2a580
```

### Narrow Bundle views

Implement these frozen, non-serializable views. Every view carries an opaque `bundle_instance_token` compared by exact registry identity and never retains an ORM object, Session, Repository, raw arguments, secret, or full Bundle reference.

```text
ProviderToolMetadataView
  ordered_contracts: tuple[ProviderToolContract, ...]
  provider_boundary_fingerprint: str

ToolDiscoveryMetadataView
  ordered_entries: tuple[ToolDiscoveryEntryV1, ...]
  policy: ToolDiscoveryPolicyV1
  discovery_fingerprint: str

ToolAuthorityMetadataView
  entries: read-only mapping[str, ToolAuthorityEntryV1]
  authority_manifest_fingerprint: str

ToolOperationMetadataView
  entries: read-only mapping[str, ToolOperationEntryV1]
  operation_fingerprint: str

LegacyDeterministicBoundaryV1
  ordered_adapter_bindings: tuple[LegacyAdapterBindingV1, ...]
  initial_route_bindings: tuple[LegacyInitialRouteBindingV1, ...]
  legacy_boundary_fingerprint: str

CompensationMetadataView
  ordered_handler_bindings: tuple[CompensationHandlerBindingV1, ...]
  compensation_fingerprint: str
```

`ToolMetadataBundleV1` is the only constructor and exposes `provider_view()`, `discovery_view()`, `authority_view()`, `operation_view()`, `legacy_boundary()`, and `compensation_view()`. Each call returns a view bound to the same token; callers cannot construct a valid token or view directly. Canonical view projections include ordered static fields and fingerprints but exclude the token, callables, and object identity. All mappings are copied and wrapped read-only at composition. `AuthoritySurfaceView` is derived only from `ToolAuthorityMetadataView + SegmentExecutionAuthority`; the old `DependencyPolicyV1` projects into `ToolDiscoveryPolicyV1` during compilation and is not retained as a second runtime source.

`OperationKind.TRANSACTIONAL_WRITE` is internal only. Existing Authority Manifest, Pending/Ledger, Journal `tool_kind`, transport, and model-visible projections continue to emit the baseline-compatible string `write`; `OperationKind.READ` continues to emit `read`.

## Task 1: Freeze independent read-only Golden assets

**Files:**

- Create: `tests/tool_metadata/__init__.py`
- Create: `tests/tool_metadata/golden.py`
- Create: `tests/tool_metadata/test_golden_assets.py`
- Create: `tests/fixtures/tool_metadata/golden_index_v1.json`
- Create: `tests/fixtures/tool_metadata/tool_metadata_manifest_v1.json`
- Create: `tests/fixtures/tool_metadata/tool_selection_matrix_0c10e05.json`
- Create: `tests/fixtures/tool_metadata/tool_operation_matrix_0c10e05.json`
- Create: `tests/fixtures/tool_metadata/resolver_implementation_bindings_0c10e05.json`
- Read: `tests/fixtures/tool_pipeline/provider_manifest_30c944f.json`
- Read: `tests/fixtures/tool_authority/authority_manifest_v1.json`
- Read: `tests/fixtures/tool_authority/dependency_policy_v1.json`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the read-only loader and failing asset tests**

`golden.py` exposes only `load_asset(name)`, `canonical_bytes(value)`, and `sha256(raw)`. Canonical JSON uses UTF-8, sorted keys, compact separators, `ensure_ascii=False`, `allow_nan=False`, and a trailing newline. Tests reject writers (`write_text`, `write_bytes`, writable `open`, update flags, environment-controlled acceptance, and fixture overwrite) under `tests/tool_metadata`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Verify RED**

```powershell
uv run pytest tests/tool_metadata/test_golden_assets.py -q
```

Expected: failure because the five assets do not yet exist.

- [ ] **Step 3: Capture from an explicit detached baseline checkout**

```powershell
$capture = Join-Path $env:TEMP 'offerpilot-tool-metadata-baseline-capture'
git worktree add --detach $capture 0c10e05e256eb757d5f89a8b009dcea193f2fc78
```

Inspect only the baseline checkout. Add reviewed canonical assets to the implementation worktree with `apply_patch`; never add a generator. After review, remove only that exact detached worktree with `git worktree remove $capture`.

The assets contain only synthetic static contract data. They must not contain entity IDs, user text, Prompt/answer content, local paths, timestamps, SQLite bytes, secrets, HMAC values, exception strings, callable repr, or object addresses.

- [ ] **Step 4: Verify exact counts and existing independent Goldens**

```powershell
uv run pytest tests/tool_metadata/test_golden_assets.py tests/tool_pipeline/test_golden_assets.py tests/tool_authority/test_baseline_golden.py tests/tool_authority/test_dependency_policy.py -q
```

Expected: exact 25 Typed, 3 Legacy, 4 Compensation, 4 required Undo, all discovery cases, and all resolver ordinals pass; production imports no test fixture.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```powershell
$taskPaths = @(Get-Content -LiteralPath "$env:TEMP\offerpilot-tool-metadata-convergence-gate\task-01.txt" | Where-Object { $_ })
git add -- $taskPaths
if (@(git diff --cached --name-only | Where-Object { $taskPaths -notcontains $_ }).Count -ne 0) { throw 'Task 1 staged scope violation' }
git commit -m "test: AI 固化工具元数据基线资产"
```

## Task 2: Add leaf policy types and canonical immutable values

**Files:**

- Create: `src/offerpilot/ai/tool_runtime/policy_types.py`
- Create: `src/offerpilot/ai/tool_runtime/metadata.py`
- Modify: `src/offerpilot/ai/tool_runtime/context.py`
- Modify: `src/offerpilot/ai/tool_runtime/__init__.py`
- Modify: `src/offerpilot/ai/tool_authority/contracts.py`
- Modify: `src/offerpilot/ai/write_operations.py`
- Modify: `src/offerpilot/ai/tool_specs/applications.py`
- Modify: `src/offerpilot/ai/tool_specs/application_events.py`
- Modify: `src/offerpilot/ai/tool_specs/notes.py`
- Modify: `src/offerpilot/ai/tool_specs/offers.py`
- Modify: `src/offerpilot/ai/tool_specs/resumes.py`
- Modify: `src/offerpilot/ai/tool_specs/jd_analyses.py`
- Modify: the exact frozen Task 2 `$capabilityImportSet` resolved from the fixed baseline in §0
- Create: `tests/tool_metadata/test_contracts.py`
- Create: `tests/tool_metadata/test_canonical.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write RED tests**

Test the exact closed enums, deep-copy/deep-freeze behavior, canonical UTF-8 JSON, bool-vs-int rejection, non-finite number rejection, string-key enforcement, bounded control-text rejection, and lack of Unicode normalization. Add an Authority test proving `_require_capabilities()` accepts the relocated exact enum and rejects lookalike enum instances.

- [ ] **Step 2: Verify RED**

```powershell
uv run pytest tests/tool_metadata/test_contracts.py tests/tool_metadata/test_canonical.py tests/tool_authority/test_contracts.py -q
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement and migrate every capability import atomically**

Move the existing eleven `ToolCapability` values to `policy_types.py`. Do not re-export them from `context.py`. Update `tool_runtime.__init__`, Authority module/type identity validation, all six domain specs, production callers, and test builders in the same commit.

Add closed `ToolDomain`, `ProviderVisibility`, `LegacyBoundaryVisibility`, `OperationKind`, `UndoPolicy`, `UndoPayloadKind`, and `CompensationKind` enums. Add `freeze_json`, `materialize_json`, `canonical_json_bytes`, and `canonical_sha256` to `metadata.py`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Verify GREEN and import boundaries**

```powershell
uv run pytest tests/tool_metadata/test_contracts.py tests/tool_metadata/test_canonical.py tests/tool_pipeline/test_context.py tests/tool_authority/test_contracts.py tests/tool_authority/test_matrix.py -q
uv run ruff check src/offerpilot/ai/tool_runtime src/offerpilot/ai/tool_authority tests/tool_metadata
uv run mypy src/offerpilot/ai/tool_runtime src/offerpilot/ai/tool_authority
```

Expected: `policy_types.py` imports no Repository, ORM, Authority Composition, Pilot Runtime, or test module; no import from `tool_runtime.context.ToolCapability` remains.

## Task 3: Define metadata DTOs and runtime-binding validation without cutting ToolSpec

**Files:**

- Modify: `src/offerpilot/ai/tool_runtime/metadata.py`
- Modify: `src/offerpilot/ai/tool_runtime/contracts.py`
- Create: `tests/tool_metadata/factories.py`
- Create: `tests/tool_metadata/test_metadata_validation.py`
- Create: `tests/tool_metadata/test_runtime_bindings.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Add deterministic test factories**

`tests/tool_metadata/factories.py` must define these concrete helpers and no fixture writer:

```text
synthetic_provider_contract(name="synthetic_tool")
read_metadata(name="synthetic_tool", domains=(applications,), dependencies=(), resolver_descriptors=())
write_metadata(name="synthetic_write", undo_policy=none, dependencies=(), resolver_descriptors=())
resolver_descriptor(resolver_id="application_identity_arg", arg_path="id")
resolver_binding(descriptor)
runtime_bindings()
presentation_binding()
synthetic_tool_spec(name="synthetic_tool", metadata=None)
synthetic_manifest()
synthetic_legacy_boundary()
synthetic_compensation_view()
compose_synthetic_bundle()
forbid_call(*args, **kwargs)
```

Every helper returns a new value; no module-global mutable object is permitted.

- [ ] **Step 2: Write RED invariant tests**

Cover read/write union exclusivity; duplicate domain/capability/dependency; Provider editable-field/schema mismatch; resolver count/ordinal/entity/presence/identity type; exact descriptor object identity; stable implementation ID; lambda/partial rejection; required Undo descriptor/callable matching; missing presentation; callable replacement after sealing; and generic serialization rejection.

Use the baseline-compatible resolver example:

```text
resolver_id = application_identity_arg
arg_path = id
entity_kind = application
presence = required
identity_type = positive_int64
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify RED**

```powershell
uv run pytest tests/tool_metadata/test_metadata_validation.py tests/tool_metadata/test_runtime_bindings.py -q
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Implement standalone final DTOs and validators**

Implement frozen `BindingResolverDescriptorV1`, `ResolverImplementationBinding`, `ToolBindingMetadataV1`, `EditableFieldMetadataV1`, `ReadOperationMetadataV1`, `WriteOperationMetadataV1`, `ToolSurfaceMetadataV1`, `UndoBuilderBinding`, `ToolPresentationBindingV1`, and runtime binding groups.

This task must not change the existing production `ToolSpec` constructor or delete its old fields. Add pure `validate_tool_spec_components(...)` and callable-identity sealing so synthetic data can be proven before the atomic production cutover. The final breaking `ToolSpec` shape is performed only in Task 4; no compatibility forwarding property is introduced.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write RED compiler, seal, compatibility, and 25-tool tests**

Tests must cover exact Manifest keys/order/nullability, duplicate names, dependency cycles, self/unknown/Legacy dependencies, mechanically closed Binding/editable/write validation, read/write union validation, runtime callable identity, recursively immutable Provider payload/parameters views, fresh detached Provider materializations, same-content Provider component replacement, Catalog topology replacement, Manifest projection replacement, Legacy kind/visibility mutation, operation-kind compatibility projection, exact four required-Undo builder bindings, complete confirmation/presentation bindings, and unchanged transport result projection.

The Manifest negative matrix is parametrized and mechanical rather than Golden-only. It must reject missing/extra/reordered keys at every nested object; wrong fixed top-level values or exact primitive types including `bool` in integer positions; wrong Typed count and wrong/gapped/duplicate/non-integer ordinals; empty/duplicate/non-canonical/unknown domains; duplicate/non-text/non-canonical/self/unknown/Legacy/cyclic dependencies; invalid Provider name/fingerprint/visibility; capability cardinality other than exactly one plus unknown/non-text capability values; every unknown/empty/duplicate/mismatched Binding contract kind/entity/nullability and resolver ID/entity/arg-path/presence/identity/count combination; editable field membership outside the Provider schema's exact top-level `properties`, duplicate fields, unknown value type, non-enum options, empty/duplicate/non-scalar enum options, clearability/clear-value type or relationship violations; confirmation/operation discriminator mismatch; write `adapter_kind`/`result_contract` drift; any write byte budget not the four fixed V1 integer values; every unknown or mismatched Undo policy/payload/Compensation/version/builder/seed combination; exact `selector_version`/`discovery_policy_version` drift; discovery-policy wrong cardinality, closed page/attachment/domain kind, behavior, term content, or ordering; exact `legacy_boundary.boundary_version` drift; Legacy kind/visibility/name/cardinality/policy/source/ordinal drift including non-exact integers; and Compensation kind/cardinality/order drift. Each axis receives an independent same-shape wrong-value mutation, not only a missing-key or whole-Golden comparison.

Presentation tests must prove that replacement bindings are constructed as complete new `ToolPresentationBindingV1` values with fresh callable-identity seals and that the replacement succeeds before a post-seal mutation fails closed. Test callbacks bound into accepted presentation metadata must be module-level named functions: no lambda, local closure, or `partial`. A lambda/local/partial may appear only as a negative constructor-rejection probe inside an assertion that it fails. Stateful cancellation/counting behavior uses a dedicated test probe/state object observed by a module-level callback; it must not place the local test function into a binding.

`test_protocol_seals.py` must independently read the committed baseline Provider and Legacy assets, canonicalize the complete ordered boundaries, recompute both approved digests, and then prove that name, order, full payload, kind, or visibility changes fail. A test that only compares two hard-coded constants is insufficient.

`test_compiler.py` must additionally spy on the production `build_model_tool_catalog()` integration: it passes the complete ordered 25 Provider payloads to `verify_provider_boundary()` before returning, and an injected seal failure prevents a Catalog from being returned or published. It must prove that `ProviderToolContract.payload`/`parameters` never materialize mutable nested JSON, that every plain-JSON result comes from the single `materialize_provider_payloads()` operation and is detached from both the contract and other results, and that Catalog registry/order/validator/manifest replacement fails closed. Direct verifier tests alone are insufficient.

Add an AST/source gate over `src/offerpilot` and the affected tests. Provider query nodes use a distinct recursively immutable internal type that the generic `materialize_json()` rejects; only the private decoder called by the one implementation of `materialize_provider_payloads()` can turn those nodes into ordinary JSON. The gate permits that one decoder call and the `ToolCatalog` delegating method, rejects access/import/alias of the private Provider decoder or snapshots anywhere else, and performs assignment-aware provenance tracking from every `.payload`/`.parameters` expression (including `tool.payload`, `spec.contract.payload`, comprehensions, and local aliases). A Provider-derived value may be inspected read-only or passed to the approved materializer, but may not reach `dict()`/`copy()`/`deepcopy()`/generic `materialize_json()`/JSON round-trip/custom mutable-tree construction. It also rejects copy-on-query compatibility mappings and public per-contract `materialize_payload()`/`materialize_parameters()`. Controlled validator cloning from an already precompiled schema remains allowed and is not a Provider-envelope materializer. The gate proves that the AI client and all Context Projector serialization paths call the approved materializer.

Mutation tests must cross the actual downstream boundaries, not stop at a direct field assertion. A same-content Provider component replacement must fail before the AI Provider adapter can return an envelope, and Catalog order/registry/validator/authority-manifest/integrity-cache replacement must fail through Provider materialization and Pipeline prepare/execute probes with Repository/executor counters remaining zero. A replaced Manifest projection must fail before `to_dict()` returns it.

```

- [ ] **Step 3: Atomically change ToolSpec and migrate all direct consumers**

Change `ToolSpec` to the approved final shape: Provider contract, metadata, resolver bindings, optional Undo builder binding, decoder/executor/preflight/mutable validator/failure mapping/renderers/projectors, and presentation binding. Remove old top-level classification fields and do not add forwarding properties.

Migrate all six domain modules and every direct consumer listed above in this same task. Encode complete metadata at declaration sites. Define each tool-specific Undo seed/build named callable beside its domain ToolSpec and bind each of the exact four directly; domain specs must not import Pilot Runtime. Bind the existing compatibility renderers, confirmation descriptors, result metadata projector, and Presentation projectors directly in every ToolSpec. The existing generic transport projector remains a compatibility boundary that consumes the exact ToolSpec `success_renderer` and `result_metadata_projector`; it is not a new ToolSpec field. Update `api.py`, `pilot_runtime/service.py`, `composition.py`, `continuation.py`, `confirmation.py`, `agent_loop.py`, and `tool_runtime/transport.py` to consume those exact bindings. Remove the two injected Undo callbacks from `build_pilot_runtime()`/`ConfirmationDependencies`; continuation resolves the exact ToolSpec binding from the existing Catalog until Segment handles arrive in Task 10. Remove `_with_write_contract`, `_with_runtime_metadata`, editable-field name lookup, confirmation-description name lookup, `_undo_seed_for_pending`, and `_build_write_undo` in this same atomic task.

Existing `MODEL_TOOL_NAMES`/`MODEL_TOOL_CATALOG` imports that have not yet moved to Bundle views may remain only until the final Runtime composition cutover in Task 11; they must be derived from the one newly compiled Catalog and must not augment or classify a tool. No placeholder Undo or presentation binding is permitted.

Compile exactly 25 ordered specs. Copy/freeze complete Provider payloads, expose only recursively immutable `payload`/`parameters` query views, precompile copied schemas, and verify resolver descriptor object identity. There is exactly one deep-copy operation named `materialize_provider_payloads()`; the Catalog method delegates to it, and the AI Provider adapter, Context Projector, compatibility fingerprints, and tests that require ordinary JSON use that operation instead of `dict(contract.payload)`, generic `materialize_json()` on Provider views, per-contract public materializers, or copy-on-query compatibility mappings. Every materialization is fresh and detached. Seal the Provider component identities and complete Catalog topology so same-value `object.__setattr__` replacement or registry/order/validator/manifest/integrity-cache replacement fails closed before Provider, Repository, or executor. Seal `ToolMetadataManifestV1` projection identity and mechanically validate every nested Binding, editable-field, exact byte-budget, Undo enum/pair/version/builder/seed rule before returning a projection. `build_model_tool_catalog()` must pass the 25 complete ordered payloads to `verify_provider_boundary()` before publishing the production Typed Catalog; generic 1..N test catalogs do not use the production seal. Task 4's Manifest compiler may consume the single whole `approved_legacy_boundary_input()` protocol projection plus one immutable pre-publication internal Legacy Manifest policy value containing exactly the three chained policies and four source-to-ordinal route bindings fixed by the design. It must not derive, cache, or publish a separate Legacy name collection, create an Adapter, or publish a partial Bundle/View. The actual ordered Legacy Adapter Catalog and its callable/provenance seal remain unpublished through Tasks 7-8. Task 9 projects the complete Legacy Manifest section from the actual three adapters, actual chained-policy metadata, and actual initial-route registry; Composition requires byte/exact equality with Task 4's full pre-publication Legacy Manifest projection and also passes the external names/visibility/kind projection independently to `verify_legacy_boundary()` before publishing the production Bundle. The internal `transactional_write` enum must project to existing external `write` everywhere outside V1 metadata.

- [ ] **Step 4: Migrate old tests instead of retaining compatibility exports**

Run `rg -n 'MODEL_TOOL_NAMES|MODEL_TOOL_CATALOG|ToolSpec\(|\.(kind|required_capabilities|binding_contract|binding_resolvers|confirmation_policy|editable_fields|write_contract|confirmation_description|result_metadata)\b' tests`. Review every match in the Task 4 scope and update every old `ToolSpec` constructor, `dataclasses.replace()` call, and direct attribute reader to the final shape. Noise from unrelated `.kind` fields is reviewed, not suppressed by narrowing the old-field list. Do not retain a legacy constructor branch or inspect `ToolSpec.__dataclass_fields__` in `tests/tool_metadata/factories.py`; after this task it constructs only the final `ToolSpec` shape.

`tests/agent_loop/helpers.py` and `tests/agent_loop/test_runner.py` must use complete freshly sealed Presentation bindings with module-level named callbacks and test probes as specified in Step 1. Their repeated inclusion is intentional: Task 4 handles only final ToolSpec/Presentation replacement, Task 9 handles Bundle/Selector composition, Task 10 handles Segment route handles, Task 11 binds exact Operation/Pending persistence Ports in the direct Typed-Pending runner fixtures, and Task 12 handles mechanical deletion gates. The Task 11 revisit adds `test_runner.py` only to `task-11.txt`; the path already belongs to the frozen global union through Task 4, so the unique `allowlist.txt`/`task-13.txt` set does not change. `tests/tool_authority/test_replay_topology.py` migrates only its Typed Presentation field access in Task 4; its Legacy proof/replay route migration remains in Task 11. Do not retain `MODEL_TOOL_NAMES` merely for tests, and do not auto-update a Golden.

`tests/tool_authority/test_approval_transaction.py` and `tests/tool_authority/test_read_uow.py` must replace copied production metadata with complete test-local metadata whose `dependencies=()` before constructing their intentional one-tool Catalogs; generic Catalog dependency closure remains fail-closed and production dependencies remain unchanged. In `src/offerpilot/ai/tool_authority/contracts.py`, validate each supplied capability through the closed `ToolCapability` enum directly; do not iterate/materialize the entire enum, create an automatic grant set, or add another capability-name collection.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write RED Bundle/view/provenance tests**

Using only `tests.tool_metadata.factories`, prove exact view fields, immutability, Bundle-token equality, cross-Bundle rejection, closed-lease rejection, lease generation monotonicity, no deepcopy/recompile after composition, no pickle/asdict/copy/deepcopy, no callable/object address in repr, and no full Catalog reference in narrow views.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement only generic primitives**

Implement `ToolMetadataBundleV1`, the six narrow views listed in §0, `SegmentToolCatalogLease`, typed route handles, Bundle fingerprinting, and provenance checks. Bundle construction is all-or-nothing and immutable.

Do not change `build_pilot_runtime()` or compose a production Bundle in this task. Production composition is deferred until real Operation, Compensation, Legacy, and proof registries exist; placeholders and mutable attach APIs are forbidden.

- Modify: `tests/test_write_operations.py`
- Modify: `tests/test_write_operation_acceptance_matrix.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write RED Operation/Undo/Compensation tests**

Prove exact 25 Typed primary, 3 Legacy primary, 4 Compensation, and 4 previously bound required Undo entries; exact route-handle provenance; session-bound compensation handlers; no tool-name set lookup; required Undo built before primary commit; and all failure/rollback/commit-unknown paths unchanged. `primary_undo.py` provides only shared runtime contract/checkpoint helpers and consumes the exact domain binding; it contains no tool-name branch and domain specs do not import it.

- [ ] **Step 2: Add the published SQLite CHECK equivalence test**

`test_published_operation_checks.py` must:

- assert both published constraint names and normalized SQL fragments remain unchanged;
- build temporary baseline and current SQLite schemas and run the same allow/reject operation-name matrix;
- assert the exact `ToolOperationMetadataPort` projection equals the CHECK allow set; Task 9 repeats this assertion against the completed production Bundle;
- assert Coordinator/Repository production code never parses CHECK SQL for routing;
- use `length(CAST(value AS BLOB))` behavior where the existing schema does so;
- never edit `models.py` or add a migration.

```

- [ ] **Step 4: Implement exact bindings without switching persistence callers**

Implement `ToolOperationMetadataPort`, opaque Typed/Legacy/Compensation route handles, shared Undo execution/checkpoint helpers, and exact four Compensation handler specs. Validate the four required-Undo bindings created in Task 4 against the exact handler registry. Handlers receive the caller-owned Session and never open another Session. Remove name switches inside the new modules.

This task exposes final Ports and tests them, but does not yet require every Pending/Ledger caller to persist a handle. The production persistence switch occurs after Legacy initial and confirmation handles exist in Task 11; no temporary handle or fallback is allowed.

## Task 7: Make Legacy adapters static and implement request-scoped initial issuers

**Files:**

- Modify: `src/offerpilot/pilot_runtime/contracts.py`

- Modify: `tests/tool_pipeline/test_legacy.py`
- Modify: `tests/pilot_runtime/test_deterministic.py`
- Modify: `tests/test_chat_api.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write RED static-adapter and issuer tests**

Cover exact three adapters, no captured Repository/Service/Session, approved Legacy seal, four reusable source-bound issuers, request-local owner/child leases, fresh token identity for consecutive same-source requests, two issuers mapping to the same Adapter remaining distinct, cross-source/container/Port rejection, issue/resolve/close linearization, ABA resistance, cancellation and every `BaseException` cleanup path.

Also assert `repr` contains no sensitive identity, copy/deepcopy/pickle/asdict/generic serialization all fail, owner close cascades revocation to every child token/handle, and none of these transient objects can enter Pending, Ledger, Journal, ChatMessage, checkpoint, HTTP, or SSE DTOs.

Add an AST ownership test proving the unpublished component factory has no production caller in this intermediate commit. Tests may import it directly; `build_pilot_runtime()`, API, deterministic services, and repositories may not. Characterize the existing `build_legacy_deterministic_catalog`, deterministic entry, and server-loaded confirmation signatures and behavior; they must remain unchanged and green until Task 9/11 replaces them. The task may add final static components but may not mutate the currently imported production factory or resolver.

- [ ] **Step 2: Add the four source-bound component matrix**

Exercise these source capabilities separately through the unpublished component factory:

```text
jd_clarification
jd_deterministic_action
submission_snapshot_action
outcome_recording_action
```

For each source, assert it receives only its source-bound issuer factory, opens one exact `RuntimeRequestOwnerLease`, issues a fresh child token, and closes/revokes in `finally` on success, Pending creation simulation, ordinary exception, cancellation, and other `BaseException`. Assert `confirmation_resume` cannot obtain any initial issuer or child-lease factory. This task does not publish the factory from application Composition or modify a production request entry; the real-entry matrix lands atomically with the final Bundle in Task 9.

```powershell
uv run pytest tests/tool_metadata/test_legacy_initial_route.py tests/tool_pipeline/test_legacy.py tests/pilot_runtime/test_deterministic.py tests/test_chat_api.py -q
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Implement trusted initial routing**

`legacy.py` owns `RuntimeRequestOwnerLease`, `LegacyInitialRequestLease`, their registry, four reusable source-bound issuer capabilities, and the exact initial-route Port. Implement one all-or-nothing component factory under new final symbols, but do not invoke or publish it from application Composition yet and do not alter the existing production factory/resolver. Only the exact issuer can derive a source-bound child lease and issue `ServerDeterministicInvocationToken`. `LegacyInitialRoutePort.resolve_initial(token)` accepts no source/name/Pending argument and returns one exact route handle. Request close and token consume are linearized under the registry lock. Task 9 atomically replaces the initial-route production path and deletes its old factory; no request can select between them.

## Task 8: Implement Legacy confirmation preparation and one-shot proof routing

**Files:**

- Create: `src/offerpilot/ai/tool_runtime/legacy_proof.py`
- Create: `src/offerpilot/pilot_runtime/legacy_route.py`
- Modify: `src/offerpilot/ai/tool_runtime/legacy.py`

- Create: `tests/tool_metadata/test_legacy_registry_composition.py`
- Modify: `tests/pilot_runtime/test_confirmation.py`
- Modify: `tests/pilot_runtime/test_confirmation_cutover.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write RED proof and Composition tests**

Cover preparation without execute capability; caller-owned read transaction; explicit-null edited args returning existing 422; locked mutable recheck; claim-before-proof; issuer/verifier/Session/Catalog/Bundle/operation/source/scope/fingerprint/key-ID mismatch; copied proof/evidence; concurrent single consume; rollback/revoke; terminal replay without Pending; reject/replay with preparation/proof/Catalog/executor all zero.

`test_legacy_registry_composition.py` must prove the unpublished component factory creates and identity-binds exactly one `LegacyPreparationRegistry`, one `LegacyRouteProofRegistry`, issuer-only registration port, proof consumer port, `LegacyPendingIdentityVerifierPort`, and Legacy Catalog component. Construction failure returns/publishes none of them. The application Composition Root does not invoke this factory until Task 9, where all identities are bound to the final Bundle atomically.

Add the same intermediate AST ownership assertion for the preparation/proof factory: no production caller exists before Task 9. Characterize and keep the currently imported `resolve_server_loaded(pending)` confirmation path byte/behavior compatible in this intermediate commit; this task adds proof components without changing that production method. Task 11 performs the one-time proof-route replacement and deletes the old method.

- [ ] **Step 2: Verify RED**

```powershell
uv run pytest tests/tool_metadata/test_legacy_confirmation_proof.py tests/tool_metadata/test_legacy_registry_composition.py tests/pilot_runtime/test_confirmation.py tests/pilot_runtime/test_confirmation_cutover.py -q
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement preparation and proof registries**

Preparation verifies trusted Pending/Ledger identity in one caller-owned read transaction, closes it, and then performs pure validation. Public objects are identity tombstones and reject repr content, copy/deepcopy/pickle/asdict/generic serialization.

The Preparation Registry owns effective arguments through the complete state machine `prepared -> consumed -> executor_returned -> cleared`. Claim/proof failure revokes and clears immediately. After a successful proof consume, only the Preparation Registry retains the arguments until the unique executor call returns; Proof Registry, Catalog, proof, and route handle never retain them. Commit, rollback, ordinary exception, cancellation, and every other `BaseException` clear in `finally`. Add spies proving arguments exist only during the executor window and are absent afterward.

After `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, mutable recheck, and confirmation claim CAS, `LegacyRouteProofIssuer.issue_after_claim()` revalidates locked primitives and existing Ledger HMAC fingerprints, atomically consumes the prepared call, and issues one proof. Catalog accepts only `resolve_server_loaded(proof)`. Catalog never receives Ledger key, Repository, ORM, raw/effective args, or ordinary DTO.

- [ ] **Step 4: Verify GREEN**

```powershell
uv run pytest tests/tool_metadata/test_legacy_confirmation_proof.py tests/tool_metadata/test_legacy_registry_composition.py tests/tool_authority/test_privacy.py tests/tool_authority/test_serialization.py tests/tool_pipeline/test_legacy.py tests/pilot_runtime/test_confirmation.py tests/pilot_runtime/test_confirmation_cutover.py -q
```

Expected approve/modify order: prepare -> locked mutable recheck -> claim -> proof -> Catalog -> executor. Reject and terminal replay call all six zero times.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write RED complete-Bundle and Selector tests**

Prove one application Composition factory atomically creates and publishes the complete Bundle containing the compiled 25 Typed specs, static 3 Legacy adapters, 4 Compensation handlers, complete Operation Port, and all six narrow views together with the exact initial Registry/Port, preparation/proof Registries, issuer/consumer ports, verifier port, and Legacy Catalog. Prove initialization failure publishes no Runtime or subcomponent. Spy on the production Legacy seal integration and prove it consumes the projection from the actual three ordered Adapter objects; an injected seal failure publishes no Runtime, Bundle, Catalog, Registry, or Port. Independently project the complete Legacy Manifest section from those actual adapters, their actual chained-policy metadata, and the actual source-bound initial-route registry, then require exact equality with the Task 4 pre-publication Legacy Manifest projection; mutate each policy and route source/ordinal independently and prove publication remains atomic. Every issuer, proof, Catalog, route handle, Compensation handler, and view must carry the same final Bundle/Catalog provenance; no pre-Bundle identity may escape. Reject any second exact Typed Catalog even when it reuses the same 25 immutable Provider contract identities, and prove Runtime publication carries the Bundle-owned Catalog identity. The complete Operation Port must accept and revoke both source-bound initial route handles and same-Bundle proof-derived confirmation handles while rejecting either origin from a foreign Bundle; use one sealed composite Legacy route verifier rather than a second Operation Port or Registry. Prove the production Agent Loop passes the same Bundle's `ProviderToolMetadataView` through the `RunRecorder` contract to `SafeRunRecorder.capture_surface_context()`, and that Manifest preparation rejects every tool name outside that injected view. The persisted-manifest reader remains structural and the Journal remains fail-open; no global Provider view, implicit fallback, or second Registry is permitted.

Migrate the existing Pilot confirmation policy-resolver compatibility assertion from rebuilding an independent Segment Catalog to requiring the exact Bundle-owned Catalog identity. Its repeated inclusion in Task 11 remains intentional: Task 9 changes only Catalog identity, while Task 11 changes the Legacy proof/replay route.

Update the component-factory AST ownership tests: exactly the approved final Composition factory may call them. API, `deterministic.py`, service, continuation, Repository, and every other Runtime builder must receive injected capabilities and may not construct/publish a second instance.

Repeat the SQLite compatibility assertion against this completed production Bundle: its Operation view must equal the published CHECK allow set. Add the four real deterministic entry sources here and prove each receives only its matching source-bound issuer factory, creates a fresh request owner lease, and closes/revokes on success, Pending creation, ordinary exception, cancellation, and every other `BaseException`. `confirmation_resume` receives no initial issuer/factory.

The final Selector signature and return contract are:

```text
select_tools(discovery_view, authority_view, trusted_signals) -> ToolSelectionResult

ToolSelectionResult
  provider_contracts: tuple[ProviderToolContract, ...]
  provider_envelope_fingerprint: str
  selected_names: tuple[str, ...]
  selected_domains: tuple[ToolDomain, ...]
  dependency_closure: tuple[str, ...]
  full_catalog_fallback: bool
  fallback_reason: no_trusted_signal | declared_ambiguous_input | null
  diagnostics: tuple[closed safe diagnostic enum/count records, ...]
```

Tests require both views to carry the same Bundle token. Cross-Bundle views fail closed. No signal or declared ambiguity selects full 25; invalid/unknown inputs, including any unknown discovery-policy version, fail closed. Dependency closure preserves full Catalog order and never admits Legacy. `ToolSelectionResult` is privately issued by the Selector module only after it proves every contract belongs to the same Bundle view and the fingerprint matches the exact ordered envelopes; callers cannot self-sign a result from a real token plus arbitrary contracts or digest. Selector computes `provider_envelope_fingerprint` exactly once from the ordered complete envelopes using the approved canonical algorithm. Authority filtering delegates final result issuance to that same private Selector issuer; it may not rebuild contracts with a name map or locally materialize/hash them. `SegmentSurfaceGate`, `ModelSurfaceProjector`, and `_surface_selection_matches()` consume this result directly; no caller rebuilds contracts from names or recomputes the fingerprint.

```

- [ ] **Step 3: Compose once and inject the Bundle views**

`build_pilot_runtime()` invokes the initial-route, proof, Compensation, and Typed component factories inside one non-publishing assembly scope, binds their opaque registries to the final Bundle/Catalog tokens, validates the complete graph, and only then publishes one Runtime. It rejects any injected Catalog other than the exact Bundle-owned production Catalog. A sealed composite Legacy route verifier accepts the initial Registry Port and proof consumer Port from that same graph and is the sole Legacy route dependency of the complete Operation Port. Provider builder consumes only `ProviderToolMetadataView`; Projector and Agent Loop receive Discovery and Authority views from that same Bundle. Migrate `SegmentSurfaceGate` and every Agent Loop Selector call to `ToolSelectionResult` in this task; no old-signature façade remains. Remove Selector-local domain/dependency/name maps and `DEPENDENCY_POLICY_V1` runtime imports. Update Manifest preparation to compare against the exact Provider view explicitly carried through the production `RunRecorder` call rather than `MODEL_TOOL_NAMES`; direct persisted-manifest validation remains structural because digest/key-domain validation owns stored-data integrity.

Before publication, Composition must pass the exact ordered names, `LegacyBoundaryVisibility.FORBIDDEN`, and `legacy_deterministic` adapter kind projected from the actual three Adapter objects to `verify_legacy_boundary()`. It must separately compare the full actual Legacy Manifest projection—including the three chained policies and four source-to-ordinal initial-route bindings—with the immutable Task 4 pre-publication policy. It must not verify a fixture, a separately maintained name tuple, or a Typed Catalog projection.

Fallback within one `model_call_id` reuses the same frozen Provider surface. An unexposed tool remains fail-closed before Dispatcher. Tool visibility does not replace Pipeline authorization.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write RED provenance and one-call tests**

Prove one Segment opens one `SegmentToolCatalogLease` through the public `ToolMetadataBundleV1.open_segment_lease()` issuer; Provider ToolCall resolves once to a typed route handle; Authority and Pipeline require exact Bundle/Segment provenance; copied/closed/cross-Bundle handles fail before resolver/preflight/executor; executor remains at most once per `execute_prepared()`.

Production Composition must open the exact Bundle-owned lease before building each NewTurn or continuation `SegmentSurfaceGate`. Approval entry must open a distinct lease from the same Runtime Bundle before reconstructing the approved call. Approval, continuation, and next-turn leases have distinct Segment tokens and monotonically increasing generations while retaining the exact Bundle token. Agent Loop owns the transient lease lifetime and closes every lease on success, ordinary exception, cancellation, any other `BaseException`, Pending return, and Approval-to-continuation transition. A raw Catalog, Bundle token, view, or private `_open_segment_tool_catalog_lease()` call may not substitute for the issuer.

Harden the generic lease primitive so the Bundle token maintains an exact live-lease identity registry independently from its already finalized immutable view registry. `ToolMetadataBundleV1.open_segment_lease()` atomically creates and registers one exact lease before publication; failed registration closes the unpublished candidate, and candidate close tolerates the exact not-yet-registered state. `SegmentToolCatalogLease.resolve()` and `require_spec()` require the exact live registered lease before using its Catalog, and close atomically revokes it before clearing issued handles; repeated close is idempotent. A structurally identical lease minted by the private helper with the same Catalog, Bundle token, Segment token fields, and generation must still fail before a Spec is exposed. Production AST gates allow the private issuer and `_register_segment_lease` only in `metadata.py`; `_require_registered_segment_lease` and `_revoke_segment_lease` are called only by the exact lease methods in `catalog.py`; every other production caller is forbidden. Public view shape and Bundle fingerprints remain unchanged.

Execution-time revalidation must also fail closed if the exact owning `ToolCatalog` topology changes after preparation, including replacement of the ordered tuple with a distinct same-content tuple, before Authority state transition, Journal/stage emission, mutable recheck, claim, or executor. The fast path may avoid revalidating every unrelated Bundle view for each Authority phase, but it may not omit the Catalog topology seal or exact issued-Spec identity. Add RED coverage for the drift and for zero downstream side effects.

- [ ] **Step 2: Lock the complete Pipeline parameter mapping**

Preserve every existing parameter and side effect while adding the exact handle:

```text
prepare_call:
  catalog lease, execution context, ToolCall, call identity, Pending identity,
  Pending revision, stage sink, proposal recorder

execute_prepared:
  PreparedToolCall, execution context, call identity, confirmation claimer,
  execution claim, locked effective-args digest, stage sink
```

The route handle replaces name lookup only; it must not remove proposal Journal events, Pending revision, confirmation claim/CAS, locked digest, mutable recheck, or stage-sink behavior. `SegmentSurfaceGate` binds one exact lease with the exact same-Bundle Authority view; `AgentLoopInvocation` carries the current lease explicitly for both NewTurn and Approval, and an `ApprovedContinuationSegment` derives its new lease from its exact surface gate rather than accepting a copied token. `PreparedToolCall` declares and retains the exact opaque handle as a required, non-optional frozen typed field with no default for execution-time revalidation; a dynamic attribute, side Registry, copied token, serialization, persistence, `None`, or constructor compatibility shape is forbidden. Every direct constructor in this Task must obtain the real handle from a complete test-local Bundle lease rather than using a fake or sentinel.

Migrate every direct test consumer listed in this task in the same atomic cutover. Tests that construct a one-tool Catalog must build a complete test-local Bundle and obtain a real lease; Authority fixtures must bind a complete test-local `ToolAuthorityMetadataView` and register the exact lease-issued handle. Do not retain a reachable raw `ToolSpec` Authority overload, `ToolCatalog` Pipeline overload, optional lease fallback, reflective signature branch, or fixture-only production path. The now-dead raw-Spec context helpers and their exports remain untouched but mechanically unreachable in production until their scheduled Task 12 deletion; the Task 10 source gate must prove that no production caller remains. Repeated inclusion of Pilot confirmation, Agent Loop, Golden, write, and Chat API matrices is intentional: Task 10 migrates their Typed Segment handle/constructor contracts, while Task 11 separately performs the Pending/Ledger/Legacy proof and transport cutover.

Authority semantic decisions for operation kind, confirmation policy, required capabilities, and binding kind must come only from the exact bound `ToolAuthorityMetadataView` entry after handle validation; the shared Spec supplies executable/schema/callable bindings only. Migrate the direct claimed-write consumer in `write_operations.py` in this task so binding pre-scope and audit helpers consume the validated Authority entry rather than `prepared.spec`; Agent Loop approval validation and event classification must likewise consume the exact Authority entry rather than raw `metadata.operation`; proposal Journal projection must receive the validated Authority entry rather than classify from raw Spec metadata. Primary Undo may still compare the immutable operation descriptor identity already bound to its callable as a topology-integrity assertion; it may not use that descriptor to make an Authority decision. Source gates must prove Agent Loop and Pipeline perform no raw `ToolCatalog.resolve()` dispatch after the lease is bound, prove the old raw-Spec context helpers have no production caller before Task 12 deletes them, enforce the issuer/register ownership in `metadata.py`, enforce require/revoke ownership in the exact `catalog.py` lease methods, and reject every other production caller. These gates must follow simple assignment/attribute aliases and receiver dataflow rather than trusting only the final callee or receiver spelling; negative fixtures must prove that storing a forbidden bound method and invoking its alias, and renaming a raw Catalog receiver before calling `resolve()`, both remain rejected.

Extend the fixed transient-security marker set in `test_pilot_runtime_extraction_gate.py` with the Bundle/View/Segment lease, token, and handle types now crossing Composition, Agent Loop, Authority, and Pipeline. Its generic-serializer and API/transport/persistence extraction gates must run in Task 10, before Task 11 touches Pending/Ledger/transport paths; Task 12 reruns and finalizes the same gate rather than first introducing this coverage.

One-shot execution is an Authority phase/identity state machine, not an unconditional consume at the first `execute_prepared()` entry. A read route permits one direct execution transition. An approved write permits exactly one outer Approval delegation through the confirmation claimer/operation executor and then exactly one inner claimed execution with the exact `ExecutionClaim` and locked effective-args digest; the inner transition is invalid until that exact outer transition has been consumed, and only that inner transition invokes the real Tool executor. Replaying either the outer or inner transition, skipping the outer transition, or resuming after an executor `Exception`/`BaseException` fails before claim, mutable recheck, Journal/stage emission, or executor. The existing two-layer write path therefore remains valid while the real executor count remains globally at most one.

The lease ownership handoff is exact: Composition/Runtime owns an unpublished candidate lease until `AgentLoopInvocation` is successfully constructed; Runtime retains an idempotent backstop until the driver/host returns, including the interval after invocation publication but before Runner entry; Runner becomes the active owner only on `run()` entry. Existing Runtime/Authority close callbacks remain the idempotent outer cleanup boundary. Continuation lease creation is lazy at continuation activation, after the Approval lease has closed; it is not opened beside the Approval lease. RED tests cover candidate construction failure, published-invocation/pre-Runner driver failure, success, ordinary `Exception`, custom `BaseException`, cancellation, Pending return, claim/executor/activation failure, immediate Approval close before continuation Provider work, continuation close, and a later next-turn third distinct token from the same Bundle. Test probes may observe this uniform path but may not toggle lease creation or preserve the old raw-Catalog shape.

Authority consumes only `ToolAuthorityMetadataView`. Pipeline accepts exact Segment route handles and preserves capability-before-binding short-circuit, binding audit-only behavior, prepare/execute separation, claim-before-executor, ordinary `Exception` mapping, `BaseException` propagation, and Journal fail-open projection. Production and test Composition must use only the public Bundle lease issuer; no caller constructs a lease from a token or obtains the shared Spec before the handle provenance check.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write RED presentation, route, and topology tests**

Golden-test success and every declared failure renderer, confirmation descriptions, sync/SSE transport payloads, result shape, and no exception/raw-args/result persistence. Test exact Typed, Legacy-initial, Legacy-proof, and Compensation route handles for initial, replacement, chained, continuation, replay, and compensation paths. Add the production approve/modify order `prepare -> locked mutable recheck -> claim -> proof -> Catalog -> executor`; reject and terminal replay must call all six zero times. The presentation RED tests must independently fix the exact three special success-projector outputs and the sync/SSE final text for `create_application`, `add_note`, and `create_application_event`.

Add RED coverage for the sealed, read-only, factory-only `PreparedLegacyInputV1` (`canonical_args`, `encoded_args`, and `confirmation_human`) and for the exact keyword-only identity signature `LegacyPreparedInputPort.require(prepared, *, operation_id, tool_call_id, tool_name)`. Only that owning Port may create the value; direct caller construction and a drift between `canonical_args` and its unique canonical `encoded_args` serialization must fail closed, and the transient value must never be persisted or exposed as a transport DTO. In `test_legacy_confirmation_proof.py`, assert the DTO's exact field set and `TransientToolRuntimeValue` contract, and apply the existing transient-privacy probe to both the DTO and Port: type-only `repr` plus fail-closed `copy`, `deepcopy`, `pickle`, `asdict`, `to_json`, and `freeze_json`. Prove that the Port rejects a prepared call from another registry, operation, tool call, or tool name; rejects revoked or otherwise invalid prepared identities; and exposes no execution, adapter, Catalog, or registry-internals surface. The Ledger must fingerprint `canonical_args` directly, while the bound route executes the matching canonical `encoded_args` from the same prepared call; no caller-supplied fingerprint or compatibility projection may participate.

The Task 11 production source gate covers every production path in this Task, including `tool_runtime/legacy_proof.py`, `tool_specs/legacy.py`, the three revisited domain Spec modules, `pilot_runtime/legacy_route.py`, and `pilot_runtime/composition.py`. Its frozen production-source tuple must include `tool_runtime/legacy_proof.py` and prove the `LegacyPreparedInputPort` has one exact production owner, no forwarding compatibility façade, and no caller-supplied fingerprint path. It rejects the exact old `ServerLoadedPending` and raw `LegacyDeterministicAdapter` declarations, the `LegacyProofDeterministicCatalog` second name, `legacy_catalog_factory`, `build_legacy_deterministic_catalog`, `_prepend_write_success`, `_last_successful_tool_payload`, and equivalent alias/subclass/dead-dependency forms. The service presentation gate must detect aliases/dataflow that inspect `pending.tool_name` or raw result keys to select success text.

Add the trusted chained matrix:

```text
typed -> typed: allowed by existing rule
typed -> legacy: rejected
same exact Legacy adapter -> same exact Legacy adapter: allowed by existing rule
one Legacy adapter -> another Legacy adapter: rejected
Legacy -> typed: rejected
Compensation -> any child: rejected
```

Migrate every direct `AgentLoopRunner` Typed-Pending fixture selected by the required Agent Loop directory matrix to bind the exact current-Bundle `ToolOperationMetadataPort` and `PendingPersistenceRoutePort` plus a test-only persistence consumer before execution. The test consumer may retain only the transient result needed by the assertion and must receive an exact route handle; it must not create a product fallback, accept an unbound raw Pending, or bypass the production Runtime fail-closed test.

- [ ] **Step 2: Verify RED**

```

- [ ] **Step 3: Perform the single persistence/runtime route cutover**

Every proposal, Pending insertion/replacement, chained Pending, confirmation continuation, primary Operation, and Compensation Operation must consume an exact sealed route handle issued by the current Bundle/Segment/Legacy proof registry. Persist only the approved primitive identity fields; never persist the handle or Bundle token.

Move Legacy approved-input projection into an exact sealed, read-only, factory-only `PreparedLegacyInputV1` containing only `canonical_args`, `encoded_args`, and `confirmation_human`, issued through the exact keyword-only identity signature `LegacyPreparedInputPort.require(prepared, *, operation_id, tool_call_id, tool_name)`. Only the owning Port may construct the value, and it must derive both argument representations from the same live prepared input, require `encoded_args` to be the unique canonical serialization of `canonical_args`, and keep the transient value outside persistence and transport. The Port is owned by the exact `LegacyPreparationRegistry`; it rejects cross-registry, cross-operation, cross-tool-call, cross-tool-name, revoked, or otherwise invalid prepared identities and exposes no execute, adapter, Catalog, or registry-internals surface. `WriteOperationCoordinator.execute_legacy()` must obtain those canonical effective arguments and the recomputed confirmation description from the same live `PreparedLegacyCall` that is subsequently executed, compute `input_fingerprint` internally from `canonical_args`, and prove that the bound route executes its matching canonical `encoded_args`. The caller-supplied `input_fingerprint` parameter and deterministic-layer editable-field reconstruction must be deleted; no alternate projection façade may remain.

Replace and delete the transitional `resolve_server_loaded(pending)` production method in this task. Migrate `tests/tool_pipeline/test_legacy.py` from direct `ServerPending` calls to proof-only resolution in the same atomic change. Confirmation resume accepts only the one-shot `LegacyRouteProof`; no old raw-Pending overload, compatibility façade, or runtime fallback remains.

Migrate `pilot_runtime/legacy_route.py` to construct and annotate the final proof-only `LegacyDeterministicCatalog` directly. Remove the raw Catalog factory definition from `tool_specs/legacy.py` and its Composition injection in `pilot_runtime/composition.py`; inject the exact production confirmation-route/Operation/Pending route components needed by the deterministic adapter instead. In the same atomic change, migrate the raw-Catalog expectations in `tests/pilot_runtime/test_deterministic.py`, `tests/tool_metadata/test_legacy_initial_route.py`, and `tests/tool_metadata/test_legacy_registry_composition.py`; the Task 11 GREEN matrix may not be satisfied by retaining the old class under an alias, subclass, dead dependency, fixture-only constructor branch, or second Catalog name.

Consume the exact ToolSpec presentation and Undo bindings established in Task 4 through the new route handles; no name-based presentation/Undo helper may return. Replace `_chained_adapter_kind()` with sealed `ChainedPendingTopologyPolicyV1`. Preserve atomic parent delivery, child proposal, Pending replacement, required Undo before commit, terminal replay, response-loss recovery, and delivery fencing.

Move the three existing special `create_application`/`add_note`/`create_application_event` success summaries into their exact domain `ToolPresentationBindingV1.success_summary_projector` callbacks. `pilot_runtime/service.py` must consume only the projection sealed into the terminal/execution record and must not inspect `pending.tool_name` or raw result keys to select presentation behavior.

Task 11's repeated modification of `tests/tool_authority/test_replay_topology.py` is limited to the Legacy proof/replay route cutover described here. The old Typed `ToolSpec.confirmation_description` attribute read was already removed in Task 4 and must not be reintroduced.

Terminal replay, delivery recovery, and fallback initialize neither Provider, Projector, Bundle resolution, resolver, preflight, proof registry, nor executor. Reject bypasses Schema, binding, preflight, proof, and executor.

Reject these symbols or equivalent runtime roles outside approved historical assets:

```text

TRANSACTIONAL_TYPED_WRITE_NAMES
REQUIRED_UNDO_TOOL_NAMES
TYPED_WRITE_OPERATION_NAMES

_build_write_undo
_CREATED_RECORD_FINGERPRINT_FIELDS
legacy_catalog_factory

```

Also reject name-based sets/maps/switches, string-prefix routing, reflective classification, non-Composition Bundle construction, Provider dict registries, Dispatcher Legacy imports, Typed-to-Legacy fallback, feature flags, shadow/double execution, Golden writers, Legacy proof imports of Ledger/keyring/Repository/ORM/Pilot Runtime, initial route calls that pass source/name/Pending rather than an exact token, and any initial/proof component-factory call outside the single approved final Composition factory.

Delete the dead `BindingResolverSpec` descriptor-plus-callable façade, its `BindingResolver` union branch and public re-export, together with the obsolete `BindingTarget` DTO and import-compatible `_UnavailableBindingTarget`/`UNAVAILABLE`/`aggregate_binding` surface. Delete the now-unreachable raw-Spec `require_capabilities`/`pre_resolver_scope_policy`/`audit_bindings`/`evaluate_context` helpers and every public re-export; their final Authority-entry replacements were completed in Task 10. Match `BindingTarget` as an exact AST symbol so the final `BindingTargetResolution` authority type remains legal. `tool_specs/common.py` must require the exact authority-bound resolution port established by the completed Bundle/Segment cutover; the old `BindingTarget` return used only by unit fixtures is an implicit runtime fallback and must be rejected rather than retained. No forwarding alias, optional port lookup, or fixture-only production branch may remain. Add a runtime negative test proving a resolver context without the exact authority-bound resolution port fails closed and never returns an old target-shaped value.

For Legacy specifically, permit only the exact static three-Adapter declaration and proof-bound final Catalog method. AST must reject the old `build_legacy_deterministic_catalog` symbol, any Legacy factory parameter/capture of Repository or Service, any `resolve_server_loaded` parameter typed/named as ordinary Pending, and every call that passes Pending/tool name instead of `LegacyRouteProof`.

For the bounded confirmation Ledger preheader, add RED coverage in `tests/pilot_runtime/test_confirmation.py` proving that Continuation calls only the exact `operation_preheader` Port and accepts only an exact `LedgerOperationPreheader`. A mapping or duck-typed wrapper, the old `load_operation_preheader` alias, and a repository without the exact Port must fail closed without calling `get()` or reconstructing a preheader from a full operation. The AST gate must reject either compatibility method name, wrapper projection, or full-operation fallback even if ordinary attribute access replaces `_attribute()`.

Exact allowlists are limited to published `models.py` CHECK text, Journal `_TOOL_NAMES`, Provider declarations, three Legacy Adapter declarations, four Compensation handler declarations, protocol seals, terminal persisted-payload renderers, and read-only test fixtures.

```

Delete production definitions and update all callers to injected Bundle views/Ports. Do not weaken gates or retain a re-export. Keep published CHECK strings and Journal whitelist byte-identical. Verify `jsonschema==4.26.0` remains exact in `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`.

## Task 13: Run release verification, independent CR, and write the report

**Files:**

- Verify unchanged scope anchor: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-25-tool-metadata-convergence-design.md`
- Verify unchanged scope anchor: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-25-tool-metadata-convergence.md`
- Create: `docs/reports/2026-08-25-tool-metadata-convergence-release-verification.md`
- Modify only when a gate finds a real defect: the exact materialized union of files already listed by Tasks 1-12

`task-13.txt` contains the two scope anchors, the report, and that inherited Tasks 1-12 union. Consequently, the union of `task-01.txt ... task-13.txt` must equal `allowlist.txt` byte-for-byte after ordinal sorting and duplicate removal.

Record exact counts/durations. Reject unexpected skip, duplicate node ID, missing group, or extra group.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run full backend/static gates**

Use the repository's Windows group manifest/aggregate procedure and compare its union with `uv run pytest --collect-only -q`. Then run:

```powershell
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check .
uv run mypy src
git diff --check
```

The external Application-JD baseline/allowlist gate may be excluded only when its release-orchestrator inputs are genuinely unavailable. Record the exact command and reason; never fabricate inputs.

- [ ] **Step 3: Run frontend and local verification**

```powershell
Push-Location web
npm test -- --run
npm run build
Pop-Location
uv run oc smoke --static-dir web/dist
uv run oc verify --local
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run controlled real-AI and browser compatibility loops**

Verify workspace and application contexts over sync and SSE:

```text
read + read
write + read
read + write
write + write
approve
modify
reject
chained Pending
terminal replay / delivery recovery
all four Legacy initial sources
one Legacy confirmation resume for each of the three adapters
```

Record Provider attempts, executor counts, Pending/Ledger state, final business readback, Journal/Trace health, console errors, duplicate API/SSE calls, and screenshots. Never log credentials or lock model prose.

- [ ] **Step 5: Request independent CR and close every P0/P1/P2**

Use `superpowers:requesting-code-review` or an equivalent fresh subagent. Review the fixed-baseline diff with emphasis on exact 25/3/4 isolation, Provider seals, Bundle/View provenance, ToolSpec consumer migration, Operation/Pending handles, Legacy owner lease and proof authorization, caller-owned Session boundaries, SQL CHECK equivalence, replay, privacy, deletion gates, and absence of dual paths. Fix every finding with a RED/GREEN test and repeat until no P0/P1/P2 remains.

- [ ] **Step 6: Verify immutable scope and write the report**

```powershell
$gateRoot = Join-Path $env:TEMP 'offerpilot-tool-metadata-convergence-gate'
$locatorPath = Join-Path $env:TEMP 'offerpilot-tool-metadata-convergence-gate.locator.json'
$locator = Get-Content -LiteralPath $locatorPath -Raw | ConvertFrom-Json
$baselinePath = Join-Path $gateRoot 'baseline.txt'
$startPath = Join-Path $gateRoot 'implementation-start.txt'
$allowlistPath = Join-Path $gateRoot 'allowlist.txt'
$baseline = (Get-Content -LiteralPath $baselinePath -Raw).Trim()
$start = (Get-Content -LiteralPath $startPath -Raw).Trim()
$branch = (git branch --show-current).Trim()
$worktree = (Resolve-Path '.').Path
if ($baseline -ne '0c10e05e256eb757d5f89a8b009dcea193f2fc78') { throw 'fixed baseline mismatch' }
if ($start -ne 'bf879fd8f10575e3996bacf8ff9c6ccc8ab7cc64') { throw 'fixed implementation-start mismatch' }
if ($locator.worktree -ne $worktree -or $locator.branch -ne $branch) { throw 'locator identity mismatch' }
if ($locator.baseline_file -ne $baselinePath -or $locator.implementation_start_file -ne $startPath -or $locator.allowlist_file -ne $allowlistPath) { throw 'locator gate path mismatch' }
$allowlist = @(Get-Content -LiteralPath $allowlistPath | Where-Object { $_ } | Sort-Object -Unique)
$taskGatePaths = @(1..13 | ForEach-Object { Join-Path $gateRoot ("task-{0:D2}.txt" -f $_) })
$missingTaskGates = @($taskGatePaths | Where-Object { -not (Test-Path -LiteralPath $_ -PathType Leaf) })
if ($missingTaskGates.Count -ne 0) { throw "task gate file is missing: $($missingTaskGates -join ', ')" }
$taskUnion = @($taskGatePaths | ForEach-Object {
    Get-Content -LiteralPath $_ -ErrorAction Stop | Where-Object { $_ }
} | Sort-Object -Unique)
if (@(Compare-Object $allowlist $taskUnion).Count -ne 0) { throw 'task union does not equal allowlist' }
$committed = @(git diff --name-only "$baseline..HEAD" | Where-Object { $_ })
$working = @(git diff --name-only | Where-Object { $_ })
$staged = @(git diff --cached --name-only | Where-Object { $_ })
$untracked = @(git ls-files --others --exclude-standard)
$reportPath = 'docs/reports/2026-08-25-tool-metadata-convergence-release-verification.md'
$reportCandidate = @()
if ((Test-Path -LiteralPath $reportPath) -and -not (git ls-files --error-unmatch $reportPath 2>$null)) { $reportCandidate = @($reportPath) }
$observed = @($committed + $working + $staged + $untracked + $reportCandidate | Sort-Object -Unique)
$outside = @($observed | Where-Object { $allowlist -notcontains $_ })
if ($outside.Count -ne 0) { throw "changed path outside immutable allowlist: $($outside -join ', ')" }
$dirtyOutsideReport = @(($working + $staged + $untracked) | Sort-Object -Unique | Where-Object { $_ -ne $reportPath })
if ($dirtyOutsideReport.Count -ne 0) { throw "unexpected dirty paths before report commit: $($dirtyOutsideReport -join ', ')" }
if (-not (Test-Path -LiteralPath $reportPath)) { throw 'release report is missing' }
git status --short --branch
git diff --check
```

The report records fixed baseline/final commit, implementation-start commit, internal destructive cutover, exact 25/3/4 boundary, unchanged external contracts, every verification result, independent CR, external exclusions, remaining risks, and explicit non-goals. It must not claim cross-request or external-system exactly-once.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit evidence**

```powershell
$taskPaths = @(Get-Content -LiteralPath "$env:TEMP\offerpilot-tool-metadata-convergence-gate\task-13.txt" | Where-Object { $_ })
$gateRoot = Join-Path $env:TEMP 'offerpilot-tool-metadata-convergence-gate'
$allowlist = @(Get-Content -LiteralPath (Join-Path $gateRoot 'allowlist.txt') | Where-Object { $_ } | Sort-Object -Unique)
$taskGatePaths = @(1..13 | ForEach-Object { Join-Path $gateRoot ("task-{0:D2}.txt" -f $_) })
$missingTaskGates = @($taskGatePaths | Where-Object { -not (Test-Path -LiteralPath $_ -PathType Leaf) })
if ($missingTaskGates.Count -ne 0) { throw "task gate file is missing: $($missingTaskGates -join ', ')" }
$taskUnion = @($taskGatePaths | ForEach-Object {
    Get-Content -LiteralPath $_ -ErrorAction Stop | Where-Object { $_ }
} | Sort-Object -Unique)
if (@(Compare-Object $allowlist $taskUnion).Count -ne 0) { throw 'task union does not equal allowlist' }
git add -f -- $taskPaths
if (@(git diff --cached --name-only | Where-Object { $taskPaths -notcontains $_ }).Count -ne 0) { throw 'Task 13 staged scope violation' }
git commit -m "docs: AI 验证工具元数据收敛发布门禁"
$dirty = @(git status --porcelain --untracked-files=all)
if ($dirty.Count -ne 0) { throw "worktree is not clean: $($dirty -join '; ')" }
git status --short --branch
```

Expected: clean worktree; do not push or merge.

## Execution order and safe parallelism

Required order:

```text
Task 1 -> Task 2 -> Task 3 -> Task 4 -> Task 5 -> Task 6
       -> Task 7 -> Task 8 -> Task 9 -> Task 10 -> Task 11
       -> Task 12 -> Task 13
```

After Task 3, tests for the six domain declarations in Task 4 may be prepared in parallel, but one owner performs the atomic ToolSpec/Catalog/consumer cutover and combined commit. Task 6 test preparation may overlap Task 5 only after Bundle contracts are frozen. Tasks 7 and 8 are security-sensitive and integrate serially. Selector tests for Task 9 and Authority tests for Task 10 may be prepared in parallel, but production composition must land before either GREEN claim. Tasks 11-13 are serial.

Intermediate commits may add unused tested leaf contracts and Ports, but production requests must never choose between old and new paths. The only complete production composition occurs after Typed, Operation, Compensation, Legacy initial, and Legacy proof components all exist. No placeholder component, mutable Bundle attachment, feature flag, shadow execution, automatic fallback, or long-lived façade is permitted.

## Completion statement

Declare completion only when all of these are true:

```text
Typed Catalog = exact 25
Legacy Boundary = exact 3
Compensation Registry = exact 4
Provider/Discovery/Authority/Operation Goldens unchanged
Provider and Legacy seals independently recomputed
all production consumers use one Bundle and exact Segment/route/proof identities
four Legacy initial sources use fresh source-bound request tokens
confirmation resume uses claim-after-proof and no initial issuer
published SQLite CHECK semantics unchanged
terminal replay and reject remain Provider/Projector/executor free
no old name-based runtime classification remains outside exact historical allowlists
HTTP/SSE/HITL/Ledger/Journal/database and business side effects remain compatible
all release gates and independent CR pass
worktree is clean; branch is not pushed or merged
```
